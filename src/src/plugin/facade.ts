/* ---------------- plugin host: permission-scoped app facade ----------------
   Spec: docs/PLUGIN_PLATFORM.md §5–§6. Decision: docs/adr/0001.

   Builds the object a plugin receives as `ctx.app`, exposing only the bridge
   methods its manifest's permissions unlock.

   This is NOT a security boundary and must not be described as one anywhere:
   plugin code runs in this realm and shares its globals, so a plugin that
   wants the full bridge can reach it. What this buys is that a call the
   manifest did not declare **throws a named error** instead of working by
   accident — so the mistake is loud during development, and the Studio review
   screen can show a user exactly which parts of the app a plugin asked for. */
