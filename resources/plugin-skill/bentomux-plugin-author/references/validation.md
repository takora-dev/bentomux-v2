# Validation reference

Generated from `src-tauri/src/plugin/validate.rs` — do not edit by hand.

Validate with:

    bentomux --plugin-validate <folder>          # human-readable
    bentomux --plugin-validate <folder> --json   # machine-readable

Exit codes: `0` valid, `1` errors found, `2` usage error.

**One run reports every problem it can find**, not just the first — so fix all
of them and run once more rather than iterating one error at a time.

## Limits

- Total plugin size: 5 MB (5 * 1024 * 1024 bytes), symlinks pointing outside the
  folder are refused.
- `apiVersion` must match the host's, currently 1. A mismatch is refused
  outright, not warned about.
- `minAppVersion` is advisory: a mismatch warns, it does not refuse.

## What is not checked statically

JavaScript syntax. The CLI path shells out to `node --check`; the in-app
validator does not, and a syntax error surfaces as a failed activation instead.
Run the CLI before installing.
